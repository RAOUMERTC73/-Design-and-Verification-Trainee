# DAYS-OF-RTL
SemiRise Training Program: currently working on a remote training focused on Digital logic design, Verilog, System Verilog, Computer Architecture, and C programming. This training has provided me with hands-on experience in designing and verifying digital circuits using advanced software tools. I have gained an in-depth understanding of how digital circuits function and have developed my skills in logic design, programming, and simulation. This experience has fueled my passion for chip design and verification, and I look forward to applying these skills to future projects in the field. In this training, I learned the Basic concept and implementation of different modules in the Verilog language which are followed as and this repo aslo a part of my course which I learned on line platform Mindluster.
