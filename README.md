# WEEKS-OF-RTL
The training Semirise is leading by the professional working in IC design and Verification companies.In this training we learn Digital logic design, Verilog and System Verilog language for IC designing and Verification, C programming, Computer Architecture for processor designing and verification.In this training, I learned the Basic concept and implementation of different modules in the Verilog language which are followed as and this repo aslo a part of my course which I learned on line platform Mindluster and  Udemy_Verilog_Comprehensive_Masterclass git practice repo.
