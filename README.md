SemiRise Training Program: currently working on a remote training focused on Digital logic design, Verilog, System Verilog, Computer Architecture, and C programming. This training has provided me with hands-on experience in designing and verifying digital circuits using advanced software tools. I have gained an in-depth understanding of how digital circuits function and have developed my skills in logic design, programming, and simulation. This experience has fueled my passion for chip design and verification, and I look forward to applying these skills to future projects in the field. In this training, I learned the Basic concept and implementation of different modules in the Verilog language which are followed as :
 ALL LOGIC GATES AND HALF ADDER.
 FULL ADDER (Three Modelling styles). 
 FULL SUBTRACTOR (Three Modelling styles). 
 8x1 Mux (Three Modelling styles).
 8x1 Mux by 4x1 mux and 2x1 mux.
 GATES BY 2X1 MUX.
 8x1 Demux.
 1x8 Demux by 1x2 demux and 1x4 demux.
 8:3 encoder.
 3:8 decoder.
 8:3 priority encoder (Behavioural model).
 BCD TO 7 SEGMENT. 
 COMPARATOR 4 BIT(Bhevioural model).
 ADDER-SUBTRACTOR.
 FLIPFLOPS (Behavioural model).
 Multiplier 4-Bit.
 Counters.
 Serial in Serial Out shift register(SISO).
 Serial in parallel Out shift register(SIPO).
 parallel in parallel Out shift register(PIPO).
 parallel in Serial Out shift register(PISO).
 Universal Shift Register.
 ALU 8-bit
 Swapping of two numbers
 N bit square number.
 FSM.
 Synchronous FIFO.
 LAST IN FIRST OUT (STACK).
 DIGITAL CLOCK.
 Simple processor Design key concept.
 Processor implementation on Verilog / System Verilog language.
